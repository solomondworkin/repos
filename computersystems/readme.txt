## Concepts of Programming
## Solomon Dworkin
##
## Running the program:
## Users must have python3 installed. There is no need to compile the code separately
## as the project is written in python. To run the program, use the command line to 
## move to the directory containing the file project0.py. At default this should 
## be the src/ directory contained in the compressed project0 folder. Then enter 
## the following in the command line:
##
## python3 project0.py
##
## The program will then prompt you for the location of the input file. Either absolute
## or relative filepaths are valid. This is an example of a valid input:
##
## /Users/Documents/current_projects/computersystems/examplefile.in
##
## The program will then write the output file to the same directory the example file 
## is located. For the above example, the output file would be written to:
##
## /Users/Documents/current_projects/computersystems/examplefile.out
##
## Output:
## The program writes an output file to the same directory of the input file. The output
## file retains the text of the input file, while stripping out single line comments
## demarcated by '//', multiline comments of the form '/* comment */', white spaces, tabs,
## and blank lines. 
##
## Notes:
##
## Functionality was only tested on macOS and linux, functionality on other operating 
## systems is untested and the program may fail.
